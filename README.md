# 🤖 GiveRep Automated Reply Bot (X.com / Twitter) 🎯

A specialized automation tool for **auto-replying to GiveRep airdrop tweets** on X.com (Twitter), powered by Chromium, `puppeteer-core`, `puppeteer-extra`, and `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth`.

### 4. Android (via Termux + Nethunter Rootless) 📱

> ⚠️ **This is the most challenging environment. Follow carefully.**

#### **A. Install Termux from F-Droid**  
- Download and install [Termux](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/) from F-Droid (not the Play Store).

```sh
nh -r
```

```sh
sudo apt install chromium
```

## 🗂️ File Preparation & Workflow

### 1. `auth.json` (for login cookies)

Create a file named `auth.json`:

```json
{
  "auth_token": "YOUR_X_COM_AUTH_TOKEN",
  "ct0": "YOUR_X_COM_CT0_COOKIE"
}
```

> **How to get cookie values:**  
> - **Method 1:**  
>   Log in to X.com, open DevTools → Application → Cookies for `.x.com` or `.twitter.com`, and copy `auth_token` and `ct0`.
>
> - **Method 2 (Recommended for most users):**  
>   1. Download and install the [EditThisCookie extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/editthiscookie-v3/ojfebgpkimhlhcblbalbfjblapadhbol) for Chrome.
>   2. Log in to [x.com](https://x.com) in your browser.
>   3. Click the EditThisCookie extension icon.
>   4. Search for and copy the values of `ct0` and `auth_token`.

### 2. `comments.txt` (your reply messages)

Each line is a possible reply. Example:
```
🚀 GiveRep to the moon! #airdrop
Don't miss the GiveRep airdrop! 💸
I’m in for #GiveRep, are you?
```

### 3. Run the Tweet Scraper

First, run the tweet scraper to collect tweets:

```sh
node scrap.js
```
- This will scrape and save up to **100 tweets** from X.com or Twitter.
- The scraped tweet URLs will be saved in `tweets_to_reply.txt`.

### 4. `tweets_to_reply.txt` (auto-generated)

- Contains one tweet URL per line, generated by `scrap.js`.
- Example:
  ```
  https://x.com/someuser/status/1234567890123456789
  https://x.com/anotheruser/status/9876543210987654321
  ```

### 5. Run the GiveRep Auto-Reply Bot

After scraping, run:

```sh
node giverep.js
```
- The bot will log in via cookies, open each tweet, post a random reply (from `comments.txt`), and save screenshots.
- Handles **1000+ replies** in a single run!

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

- **Chromium path** (`chromiumPath` in script, but defaults work on Termux/Linux/macOS)
- **Proxy** (set `HTTP_PROXY` env variable if needed)
- **User-agents** (customizable in script)
- **Reply delays** (randomized for anti-bot)

### 💡 To automate different subjects:
- Change the search keywords in the script’s config section.
- Change the reply messages in `comments.txt`.

## ▶️ Usage Recap

1. **Scrape tweets:**

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

- **Chromium not found:**  
  Edit `chromiumPath` to match your installation.

  Refresh your cookies in `auth.json`.
- **Tweet not loading:**  
  Ensure cookies are valid and not rate-limited.
- **Selector not found:**  
  X.com UI changes may require updating selectors in the script.
